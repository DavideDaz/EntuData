I work on the development of a Safety Analysis Software for Nuclear Power plants and as Data expert for the Analysis of the events related to the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident.

My main roles include the implementation of models and algorithms to perform the safety analysis simulations and their integration within the code's architecture. I employ Python and MatLab for data analysis and visualization to evaluate relevant information regarding the severe accident.

This is what progressively pushed me towards Data Science and grew my interest in data-driven business solutions.

I am a Machine Learning passionate and try to leverage it to find elegant solutions to the work projects and everyday life. I am currently enrolled in a Data Science School to expand my skills in AI and ML:
